# Blockcerts and Open Badges as Verifiable Claims

### Note on terminology

Philipp/Nate: suggestions welcome!!

This uses the term "document" to refer to a credential being issued to a recipient. This is to avoid confusion with terms that already have precise meanings in the Verifiable Claims data model](https://opencreds.github.io/vc-data-model/). Note that the existing Open Badges/Blockcerts formats roughly correspond to a set of Claims and Identity Profiles in the VC definitions.

## Context

[Blockcerts](http://www.blockcerts.org/) is a certification infrastructure that puts recipients in control of their achievements and accomplishments. It consists of open standards and open source libraries enabling blockchain issuing and verification of documents. The Blockcerts is [Open Badges](https://openbadgespec.org/) compliant. We are working with the OBI team to contribute these blockchain extensions to the Open Badges standard, enabling blockchain verification for the broader Open Badges community.

Blockcerts uses the blockchainn, as opposed to traditional PKI techniques, as a scalable way to enable trustless verification of claims, and recipient control of their data. The role of trusted timestamps provided by construction with a blockchain solution...

Blockcerts intentionally does not address identity -- partiticipants are represented only by their cryptographic keys. However, a decentralized identity or a web of trust approach would fit perfectly with the architecture and ideals of the problem.

The Blockcerts and Open Badge communities are interested in participating in the Verifiable Claims ecosystem and community. This describes potential topics for Rebooting Web of Trust Spring 2017 to enable aligning standards and specifications to the VC framework.

## Rebooting Web of Trust Spring 2017 Topics

The following topics are smaller in scope and could feasibly be addressed at RWOT. Details of each follow

- Aligning signature schema and techniques, including proof of publication-style Merkle proofs
- Expressing recipient cryptographic key in the issued document, allowing recipient to make a strong claim of ownership

The following are broader topics that require further elaboration, but any conversation along these lines would be useful. 

- Integrating a decentralized identity approach with Blockcerts
- Longevity of credentials
- Broader alignment of Open Badges into claims

## Aligning signature schema and techniques

Blockcerts uses Merkle proofs and JSON-LD signatures as part of verification (it relies on JSON-LD canonicalization to predictably format an input json-formatted document). The format is heavily inspired by specifications generated by RWOT and Verifiable Claims groups, including:

- [EcdsaKoblitzSignature2016](https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/lds-koblitz2016/) are formatted as follows:
- [Proof of Publication](https://web-payments.org/specs/source/pop2016/)

Blockcerts currently uses Chainpoint V2 merkle receipt format, with plans to enable other formats, e.g. [Peter Todd's Open Timestamps](https://petertodd.org/2016/opentimestamps-announcement). Further details are at the end.

Some aspects of JSON-LD signatures are not an ideal fit for blockchain verification, which has resulted in duplication and ambiguity in some of our schema.  Per a recent email thread, there is interest in alignment with JOSE/JWS, but we also have some concerns with this (per Manu's email, details are emerging soon and my concerns may be out of date).

In general, clarification and generalization of the JSON-LD signature standard (and/or its evolution with JOSE/JWS) would help express blockchain signatures.

Concerns include:

- The 'signatureValue' field is not necessary if the issuing key is the same used to sign the document (which is true in the Blockcerts case). 
    - Could `signatureValue` be removed as a required field in favor of the merkle proof?
    - Per (XXX) thread, there are additional concerns with relying on Koblitz signature as standalone. 
- 'created' is less important than the blockchain timestamp. Including this field in a blockchain certificate introduces confusion as to the interpretation of this field. One option is to clarify the role of the transaction timestamp in verifiction.
- 'creator' field, if assumed to be the issuer of the blockchain transaction, is present in the transaction
    - Note that OBI/Blockcerts allows specification of Issuer Key URI ('creator' field) in the issuer profile. The type is [Key](https://web-payments.org/vocabs/security#Key). In Blockcerts, it is enforced to be the same.
- JOSE/JWS: we are very interested in alignment of json-ld signatures with JWS, but have concerns about the resulting format and usability. [List of historical concerns have been outline here](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2016/blob/6674642d88aaeee07489d98ddd75bf89aff5ecee/topics-and-advance-readings/blockchain-extensions-for-linked-data-signatures.md#json-normalized-clear-text-signatures).

Other questions
- Any interest in revisiting Proof of Publication? 
- Dropping of additional fields in JSON-LD normalization
  - Blockcerts addresses this through use of the '@vocab' keyword to detect fields not present in any JSON-LD context.

## Recipient Strong Claim of Ownership

Embedding the recipient's cryptographic key in the certificate allows the recipient to make a strong claim of ownership (by signing a message). For that reason, we want to include (as an OBI extension) a public key that the recipient owns in the credential. 

In the Blockcerts model, the credential recipient provides their own public key (in advance of issuing) to the issuer. The notion of identity is external to the Blockcerts project; it is assumed (and enforced in various ways in implementations) that the issuer and recipient have a separate means of establishing identity and transferring keys.

Current version has added 'publicKey' and reserved 'id' on the recipient profile object for future expression as a DID

## Long term questions
- Anything that is assumed to be hosted (issuer profiles, etc) should have high confidence of permanence (e.g. IPFS hosting)
- Key rotation?
- DID
- Putting recipient in the communication

## Reference

This is a technical summary of the Blockcerts approach, for reference:

### Blockcerts Issuing

- Input is a batch of json-formatted documents (currently content of each is an OBI-compliant badge)
- For each document:
   - perform JSON-LD normalization
   - take SHA256 hash of normalized result
   - add hash to Merkle tree
- Issue Merkle root on blockchain. The transaction is signed with issuer's cryptographic key (e.g. bitcoin blockchain uses a bitcoin public address)
- Additionally, for each document, sign the JSON-LD normalized payload consistent with JSON-LD signatures 

The resulting Blockcert contains the original document and the signature/merkle proof. JSON-LD normalization, along with merkle proof allows predictable verification of the issued document

Note that the last JSON-LD signature step is unnecessary. Because each document is sha256 hashed and placed into a merkle tree, issued on the blockchain, and the issuer signing key is the one performing the blockchain transaction, the separate signatureValue is actually unnecessary. 

### Blockcerts Verification

- Fetch blockchain transaction info
	- issuing address
	- op_return field (or similar anchor)
	- time
 - Issuer profile/Issuer key


Steps:

- Check integrity; has not been tampered with
	- Ensure local hash matches value in proof
	- Ensure value in blockchain transaction matches value in proof
	- Check merkle proof: essentially verification of the intermediate steps in the merkle path
- Signature/authenticity
	- Establish 2-way link between issuer's profile and issuing key. I.e. is this issuing key actually claimed by the issuer? 
	- Establish that the transaction was issued WHEN issuer key was valid
	- JSON-LD signature (EcdsaKoblitzSignature2016) -- technically unnecessary
- Not revoked
	- The Open Badge format expects a revocationList URI, currently expected to be hosted URL in a certain format. See long term notes
- Not expired
	- Open badges standard supplies an expiration date field, which is currently used by verification. See long term notes.
