# Rebooting the Web-of-Trust

This repository contains documents related to the "Rebooting the Web-of-Trust" series of events in the spring of 2017.

## DesignShop April 19th - 21st, 2017

The [fourth DesignShop event](https://www.eventbrite.fr/e/billets-rebootingweboftrust-design-workshop-paris-2017-32228513351), to be held in the Paris, France on April 19th, 20th, & the 21st 2017, is a facilitated, invite-only event focused on creating the next generation of decentralized web-of-trust based identity systems. The goal of this initial DesignShop is to generate 5 technical white papers and/or proposals on topics decided by the group that will have the greatest impact on the future.

### Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the April DesignShop, all participants were requested to post in the [Topics and Advanced Readings](topics-and-advance-readings) folder a 1 or 2 page topics paper to be shared with other attendees on either:
* A specific problem that you'd like to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (pgp or ca-based pki) can't address the problem?
*  A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

_We'll update this with a list of topic papers as they arrive._

### Other Readings of Interest

Following are some of the informative or notable papers from past design shops. They're good reading to understand who we are and what our priorities and goals are:

   * [Rebranding the Web of Trust](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/rebranding-web-of-trust.pdf) — What is the Webof Trust? A quick overview.
   * [DID Implementer's Draft](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2016/blob/master/final-documents/did-implementer-draft-10.pdf) — The draft for decentralized identifiers, the most robust and complete spec to come out of our design shops.
