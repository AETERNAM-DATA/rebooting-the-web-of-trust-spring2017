# Rebooting the Web-of-Trust

This repository contains documents related to the "Rebooting the Web-of-Trust" series of events in the spring of 2017.

## DesignShop April 19th - 21st, 2017

The [fourth DesignShop event](https://www.eventbrite.fr/e/billets-rebootingweboftrust-design-workshop-paris-2017-32228513351), to be held in the Paris, France on April 19th, 20th, & the 21st 2017, is a facilitated, invite-only event focused on creating the next generation of decentralized web-of-trust based identity systems. The goal of this initial DesignShop is to generate 5 technical white papers and/or proposals on topics decided by the group that will have the greatest impact on the future.

### Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the April DesignShop, all participants were requested to post in the [Topics and Advanced Readings](topics-and-advance-readings) folder a one- or two-page topics paper to be shared with other attendees on either:

* A specific problem that you'd like to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (such as PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem.
*  A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to.
